# SLP-MLP-From-Scratch-MNIST
Single Layer Perceptron and a Multi-Layer Perceptron. You are going to train and test the implemented algorithms on the MNIST dataset


Part 1) The Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)

a) Implement an SLP where the inputs are 784-dimensional flattened images and the outputs are 10
dimensional class probabilities.

b) Train the perceptron for a number of epochs (e.g., 50) using the training dataset and plot the
accuracy values for each epoch on both training and test datasets.

c) Report the confusion matrices for both training and test datasets using the predictions with the
highest accuracy obtained during training.

d) Each output unit has 784 weights coming to them. Visualize those weights as an image for each
output unit.

Part 2) The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

For H=25, 50, 75

a) Implement an MLP where the input is a 784-dimensional flattened image, the hidden layer
has H units, and the outputs are 10-dimensional class probabilities.

b) Train the perceptron for a number of epochs using the training dataset and plot the
accuracy values for each epoch on both training and test datasets.

c) Report the confusion matrices for both training and test datasets using the predictions
with the highest accuracy obtained during training.
